## [A world of wild contrasts](https://finland.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=218875&nodeid=37598&culture=en-US#haitari)

The most obvious contrast is between the annual seasons. The same lake where people come to swim and sail in summer forms a perfect skating rink or skiing arena in the winter. Warm, light summer nights gradually lengthen, until the snow settles and the late dawn merges colourfully into the early sunset during the midwinter season known to Finns as kaamos.

The country’s population is concentrated in the south, especially around the Helsinki region, which is home to about a million people. At the other end of the country lie the vast unpopulated forests and fells of arctic Lapland.

But the scenery also changes on a smaller scale. Water is never far away. Dense forests always await somehwhere nearby. And there is also sure to be open bog or farmland within easy reach. All of these landscapes are part of Finland’s varied natural scene.
